# Chapter 5: Using IDs in Trade Execution

As we have already learned in the previous chapter of the book, that managing orders is an integral part of any trading system. The next stage in this process is trade execution. 

Trade execution is the process of executing buy or sell orders that have been placed by traders in a timely and efficient manner. One of the critical elements of trade execution is to keep track of the transactions to ensure that both buyers and sellers receive a fair deal. 

In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of IDs in trade execution and how they are used to keep track of transactions. We will show how IDs can be used in trading systems built with C++, Python, and Java to manage trades efficiently. 

Our discussion will be built around a captivating Sherlock Holmes mystery. Using our detective skills, we will help Sherlock solve a complex trade execution problem using IDs. So put on your detective hat, grab your magnifying glass, and get ready to solve the mystery.
# Chapter 5: Using IDs in Trade Execution

As we have seen in the previous chapter, managing orders is crucial in any trading system. But it's not enough to place orders, executing those orders in a fair, efficient, and timely manner is equally essential. In this chapter, we will dive into trade execution and focus on the importance of IDs in that process.

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective, received a letter from a client complaining about a trade execution gone wrong. The client had placed an order to buy 100 shares of a company at $10 per share, but the execution took place at $11.05 per share. Now, the client was claiming the broker executed the trade at a higher price on purpose to make extra profit.

Sherlock, with his skeptical mind, started his investigation by asking for the order ID, which should have been generated when the client placed the order. But the broker denied any existence of an order ID associated with the client's request, stating that they do not record order IDs as they directly execute orders from the client.

Without any ID to go on, Sherlock had to think outside the box. He dug deeper into the system and found a trace of a ticket ID associated with the trade, but no mention of the order ID. The ticket ID showed that the trade was executed internally by the broker using their own trading desk.

Sherlock needed to use his technical skills and build a program that compares the executed trade details with the initial client order request, as no order ID was available. Here is the sample Python code that he constructed:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, side, price, quantity):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.side = side
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

class Execution:
    def __init__(self, trade, ticket_id):
        self.trade = trade
        self.ticket_id = ticket_id

class Broker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executions = []

    def execute_trade(self, trade):
        ticket_id = self.generate_ticket_id()
        execution = Execution(trade, ticket_id)
        self.executions.append(execution)
        print(f"Trade executed with ticket ID: {ticket_id}")

    def generate_ticket_id(self):
        return uuid.uuid4()

broker = Broker()
order = Trade("AAPL", "BUY", 10, 100)
broker.execute_trade(order)
```

## The Resolution

Sherlock used the above Python program to simulate the trade execution process with the broker's trading desk. The broker generates a unique ticket ID with every executed trade.

Sherlock found out that the trade execution process with the broker's trading desk was not automated and required a manual intervention from the agent. Therefore, he concluded that the agent might have executed the trade at a higher price for their benefit.

However, as the ticket ID was unique to each trade, it could not be manipulated. And, as Sherlock had access to the ticket ID for the trade in question, he could compare the details of the executed trade with the initial client order request. The comparison showed that there was an error in the trade execution process, and the broker accepted their mistake and refunded the overcharged amount to the client.

In conclusion, the use of IDs in the trade execution process is critical to verify the accuracy of trading systems. If the system uses ID values for each trade, then there is a solid basis for auditing and ensuring that trades are executed fairly and correctly.
# Explanation of the Code

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we saw how IDs are essential for trade execution. Sherlock used Python to build a basic trade execution simulation that generates unique ticket IDs for each executed trade. This system guarantees that each trade executed would have a unique identifier associated with it.

Here is an explanation of the code used in the program:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, side, price, quantity):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.side = side
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity
```

The `Trade` class contains the details of an order, such as the ticker symbol, side, price, and quantity. These are the details that the clients submit for a trade execution request.

```python
class Execution:
    def __init__(self, trade, ticket_id):
        self.trade = trade
        self.ticket_id = ticket_id
```

The `Execution` class has an instance of the `Trade` class and a unique ticket ID associated with it. The ticket ID assures the identity of the trade, as it is unique for each executed trade.

```python
class Broker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executions = []

    def execute_trade(self, trade):
        ticket_id = self.generate_ticket_id()
        execution = Execution(trade, ticket_id)
        self.executions.append(execution)
        print(f"Trade executed with ticket ID: {ticket_id}")

    def generate_ticket_id(self):
        return uuid.uuid4()
```

The `Broker` class has a list of all `Execution` instances that it has handled. The `execute_trade` method receives the client order's details and generates a unique ticket ID for the executed trade. The `generate_ticket_id` method returns the unique ticket ID using the `uuid` python module.

```python
broker = Broker()
order = Trade("AAPL", "BUY", 10, 100)
broker.execute_trade(order)
```

The last two lines of the code create an instance of the `Broker` class and sell 100 shares of AAPL at $10 through the `execute_trade` method mentioned above.

In conclusion, the code illustrates how IDs can be used to ensure the accuracy and transparency of trade executions. As the ticket ID is unique for each executed trade, it can be used to verify the details of an order and compare it with the details of the executed trade to ensure that the trade adhered to the client's original order request.
