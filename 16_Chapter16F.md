# Chapter 16: Future Trends in Using IDs in Trading Systems

As we move forward with the implementation of various Trading Systems, it becomes increasingly vital to understand and make use of the unique system IDs. In the previous chapter, we explored the Case Studies of some of the most successful Trading Systems and how they make use of these IDs.

Now, in this chapter, we will dive deeper into the evolution of IDs and how they can be used to take your Trading System to the next level. We will investigate the latest trends in using IDs, including the latest algorithmic trading strategies, and how they interact with the unique identification of different orders, trades, and positions.

We will also explore how to effectively use IDs to better manage liquidity, reduce risk, and gain a significant edge in increasingly competitive financial markets. 

So, let's get started on this next chapter in which we will uncover the latest trends in using IDs to improve Trading System performance.

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes and his team were invited by a successful trading firm to investigate an issue that had been plaguing them for weeks. Every time they placed orders in the market, their trades were getting executed at a price far away from their desired price.

Upon close inspection of their Trading System, Sherlock Holmes realized that they were making a simple, yet common mistake. They were using two different market data providers on their Trading System, one of which was delaying the data by several minutes. As a result, all their orders were being executed at outdated prices.

But the important question now was, why did this only start happening recently? The trading firm had been using this same setup for years, and it had always worked perfectly fine.

After thorough investigation, Holmes discovered that the Trading System had been updated a few weeks ago, and new IDs had been introduced to keep track of orders coming from both the data providers. However, the Trading System had not been correctly configured to differentiate between orders coming from the different data providers. Hence, these orders were getting mixed up, leading to the faulty trades.

The solution was quite simple. The team reconfigured the Trading System to use separate IDs for orders coming from each data provider. This removed the ambiguity in the Trading System and restored its functionality to optimal levels.

## The Resolution

In the end, Sherlock Holmes realized that the use of unique IDs in Trading Systems is imperative, and can become even more critical in the future. With increasing amounts of data and order flow, the use of IDs helps to better manage the Trading System's functionality and ensure accurate processing of trades.

He also pointed out that new and innovative uses of IDs, like the introduction of Blockchain technology, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, can provide further insights and opportunities for traders to gain a competitive edge.

In conclusion, the detective team left the successful trading firm with a more efficient and functional Trading System, reminding them of the importance of using unique IDs to keep their Trading System running smoothly and profitably.

## Explanation of Code Used to Resolve the Mystery

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, the trading firm was using two different data providers to get market data. The Trading System had been updated, and new IDs were introduced for tracking orders coming from both data providers. However, these IDs were not configured correctly, and orders from both data providers were getting mixed up, leading to faulty trades.

To resolve this issue, the team reconfigured the Trading System to use separate IDs for orders coming from each data provider. Here, we provide code snippets in C++ to demonstrate how the issue was resolved:

```C++
// Before
struct Order {
    int orderID;
    double price;
    int quantity;
    int dataProvider;
};
```
Here, the Order object was being tracked with an "orderID" and had an additional "dataProvider" parameter to keep track of the data provider it came from. However, the dataProvider parameter was causing ambiguity and leading to mixed up trades.

```C++
// After
struct Order {
    int orderID;
    double price;
    int quantity;
    int dataProviderID;
};

struct DataProvider {
    int dataProviderID;
    string name;
};
```

To correct the issue, the team restructured the data model by creating a separate "dataProvider" object. This way, each order was related to its data provider by a unique "dataProviderID" and was not confused with other data providers in the Trading System.

```C++
// To assign data provider ID
DataProvider dp1 = {1, "DataProvider1"};
DataProvider dp2 = {2, "DataProvider2"};

Order order1 = {1, 10.50, 100, dp1.dataProviderID};
Order order2 = {2, 8.75, 200, dp2.dataProviderID};
```
The code snippet demonstrates how the new IDs were assigned to orders with their corresponding data providers. Here, the "dataProviderID" links each order object to a particular data provider, and there is no longer ambiguity in the Trading System about the orders' source.

```C++
// Separate logic for different data providers
vector<Order> dataProvider1Orders;
vector<Order> dataProvider2Orders;

for (const auto& order : AllOrders) {
    if (order.dataProviderID == dp1.dataProviderID) {
        dataProvider1Orders.push_back(order);
    } else if (order.dataProviderID == dp2.dataProviderID) {
        dataProvider2Orders.push_back(order);
    }
}
```
Finally, separate logic was written for the different data providers to ensure that orders from different providers were not mixed up. Here, the orders were pushed into separate vectors, providing clarity in managing the orders from different data sources.

With these changes to the Trading System, accurate tracking of orders from different data providers was ensured, and clarity was restored to the Trading System, thereby enabling the team to function efficiently and profitably.
