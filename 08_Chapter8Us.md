# Chapter 8: Using IDs in Backtesting & Simulation

Welcome back, dear readers! We hope you enjoyed our last chapter on using IDs in Risk Management. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of IDs in backtesting and simulation, which is essential in evaluating the performance of trading strategies.

As you know, backtesting and simulation are an integral part of any trading system development process. They allow us to test our trading strategies against historical data and evaluate their performance under different market conditions.

However, to conduct these tests, we need to identify each trade and market data point uniquely. This is where IDs come into play. IDs are unique identifiers assigned to each trade and market data point, enabling us to track them individually and analyze their performance independently.

In this chapter, we will show you how to use IDs in backtesting and simulation by implementing them in Cpp, Python, and Java code. We will walk you through how to backtest and simulate trading strategies using IDs, and how to analyze the results.

So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to use IDs in backtesting and simulation. Let's dive right in!
# Chapter 8: Using IDs in Backtesting & Simulation

## "The Case of the Missing Trades"

Sherlock Holmes had been summoned to investigate a peculiar case. A hedge fund had reached out to him after realizing that their backtesting and simulation results were not as expected. The fund's manager, John Watson, couldn't explain why the returns were not matching the expected results. 

"It's as if some of our trades aren't being factored in," Watson exclaimed to Holmes.

Upon investigating, Holmes found that the hedge fund had been using IDs to track their trades, but some of the IDs were missing from the backtesting dataset. After further investigation, Holmes discovered that the backtesting dataset was being generated by a separate team than the one handling the live trading. Due to miscommunication, the team generating the dataset was not including all the necessary trade IDs.

To solve the case, Holmes suggested that the two teams merge their databases and cross-check their data for any missing IDs. Once the missing IDs were identified, they were added to the backtesting data, and the hedge fund's performance was re-evaluated. The results now matched the expected outcomes, and the case was solved.

## The Resolution

IDs are critical in backtesting and simulation as they are used to uniquely identify each trade, allowing us to track them individually and analyze their performance independently. In this case, the missing IDs resulted in inaccurate backtesting and simulation results, causing the hedge fund to question their execution. Once they identified the issue, however, and added the missing IDs back into their dataset, the results were back on track.

To avoid similar issues, it's essential to ensure that all necessary IDs are included in the backtesting and simulation datasets. This can be done through cross-checking or automated processes, ensuring data quality and accuracy.

Now that you have learned about the importance of IDs in backtesting and simulation, it's time to implement them in your own trading systems to ensure you don't run into missing trade issues like the hedge fund in this case.
Certainly, let's first take a look at the code used to cross-check and merge the two datasets:

```python
# Import pandas library to work with dataframes
import pandas as pd

# Read in the live trading data
live_trading_df = pd.read_csv('live_trading_data.csv')

# Read in the backtesting data
backtesting_df = pd.read_csv('backtesting_data.csv')

# Cross-check the two dataframes to identify any missing trades
missing_trades = live_trading_df[~live_trading_df['trade_id'].isin(backtesting_df['trade_id'])]

# Add the missing trades to the backtesting dataset
backtesting_df = backtesting_df.append(missing_trades)

# Save the updated backtesting dataset to a new csv file
backtesting_df.to_csv('updated_backtesting_data.csv', index=False)
```

As you can see, we used the pandas library to work with dataframes. We first read in the live trading data and backtesting data using the `pd.read_csv()` function. We then cross-checked the two dataframes using the `isin()` function to identify any missing trades. The `~` operator negates the `isin()` function, returning a boolean series where the values are not present in the backtesting dataframe.

Next, we added the missing trades to the backtesting data using the `append()` function. Finally, we saved the updated backtesting data to a new csv file.

In summary, by using code like this, we can merge the live trading and backtesting datasets, cross-check for any missing trades, and ensure that all necessary trade IDs are included in the backtesting and simulation data.
