## Trading Systems: An Introduction

Welcome to the world of trading systems! In this chapter, we will introduce you to the world of trading systems and how you can use them to your advantage. To help us understand the topic better, we have a special guest with us today â€“ John F. Ehlers.

John F. Ehlers is a pioneer in the field of technical analysis and he has been involved in the development of many popular trading indicators. He is also the author of several books on trading systems and technical analysis.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

1. What is a trading system?
2. Why use a trading system?
3. Benefits of using a trading system.
4. Trading system components.
5. Types of trading systems.
6. Common trading strategies.
7. How using IDs in trading systems plays a role.

We will discuss each of these topics in detail and provide examples, code samples, and practical advice to help you design and implement profitable trading systems.

So, whether you are new to trading or an experienced trader, this chapter will provide you with valuable insights into the world of trading systems.

Let's get started!
## The Mysterious Disappearance of Profitable Trades: A Sherlock Holmes Mystery

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were sitting in their study when they received a letter from a distraught client. The letter read:

"Dear Mr. Holmes,

I am a trader and I have been using a trading system to make profitable trades. However, over the past few days, my system has stopped working and I have been losing money. I have reviewed the system and everything seems to be in order but I am unable to find the cause of the problem. Please help me find the issue and solve the mystery of the disappearance of profitable trades.

Sincerely,
Distraught Trader"

Holmes and Watson were intrigued by this case and decided to take it up. They asked the client to provide them with the trading system's code, and they also reached out to John F. Ehlers for his expert opinion.

After reviewing the code, Ehlers noticed that there were no IDs assigned to any of the trades the system executed. When Holmes asked about the significance of IDs, Ehlers explained that IDs can be used to uniquely identify trades and that they are an essential component of any trading system.

Holmes and Watson proceeded to update the code and add ID to each trade using Python. They used a simple counter variable to generate unique IDs for each trade. 

```python
# Sample Python code to add ID to each trade
id_count = 0
for trade in trades:
    trade['id'] = id_count
    id_count += 1
```

They also checked the system for other possible issues, and found out that there was a bug that had been introduced in the code. This bug caused the system to generate more trades than it should have. 

After fixing the bug and adding IDs to each trade, they ran the system again, and instantly saw an improvement in the system's performance. The profitable trades were back!

In conclusion, the mystery of the disappearance of profitable trades was solved by implementing proper IDs in the trading system. It just goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the seemingly small details like IDs when designing and implementing trading systems. 

Thanks to John F. Ehlers' expert opinion, Holmes and Watson were able to successfully solve the case and their client was able to resume making profitable trades once again.
The code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery was a simple Python script that added unique IDs to each trade in the trading system. The code is as follows:

```python
# Sample Python code to add ID to each trade
id_count = 0
for trade in trades:
    trade['id'] = id_count
    id_count += 1
```

The script initializes a counter variable `id_count` to 0, and then iterates over all the trades in the trading system. For each trade, it adds a new key-value pair to the trade object using the key `'id'` and the value of the `id_count` variable. It then increments the `id_count` variable to ensure that each trade has a unique ID.

By adding unique IDs to each trade, it becomes much easier to track each trade individually and debug any issues with the system. IDs can also be used to filter, group and sort trades based on specific parameters, providing valuable insights into the performance of the trading system.

This simple addition of IDs to the trading system not only helped solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery but it also drastically improved the system's performance, allowing the client to resume making profitable trades.
