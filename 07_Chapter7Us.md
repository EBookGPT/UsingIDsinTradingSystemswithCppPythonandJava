# Chapter 7: Using IDs in Risk Management

Greetings, dear reader! I presume that you have now understood the significance of IDs in Position Management in your trading system.  Now, it's time to delve into the next level of trading systems. This chapter will cover one of the most crucial aspects of any trading system, Risk Management. 

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risk followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events. It is pivotal in ensuring steady and profitable trading.

One of the most common ways to manage risks is to define limits on the amount of risk taken by the system per trade or per day, which typically depends on the trader's risk appetite. As you can see, the topic is vast and requires seamless tracking, which can be achieved using IDs.

By implementing IDs in Risk Management, one can easily monitor their exposures and limit their risks. Hence, this chapter will focus on how to use IDs in Risk Management using Cpp, Python, and Java code. 

So, gear up, and let's begin our journey of implementing IDs in Risk Management to make more informed trading decisions that keep profits high and risks at bay!
# Chapter 7: Using IDs in Risk Management

## The Mystery of The Anonymous Trader

Sherlock Holmes took a sip of his hot tea and carefully placed the cup back on the saucer. His eyes were fixed on the screen displaying trading charts, his mind lost in thoughts. A young trader, John, entered the room and bowed courteously. "Good morning, Mr. Holmes," John said in a nervous voice. "I'm seeking your help with a rather strange problem I've been having with my trading system. I've realized that I have been losing an abnormal amount of money lately, even though my strategies had high returns in the past."

Sherlock Holmes raised an eyebrow and asked, "What is your trading system, John?"

John replied, "I have developed an automated trading system that executes trades based on a set of pre-defined rules. It uses risk management techniques to keep my loss at bay. However, I'm not sure what has changed since the system was working flawlessly."

"Now, that's interesting, John," replied Holmes. "Let's have a look at your trading system together."

They analyzed the code of the automated trading system, but the code seemed to be working correctly. As Holmes dug deeper, he discovered that John's system was executing trades without applying any stop-loss or take-profit orders.

Holmes wondered if this malfunction had anything to do with the ID implementation or monitoring. He carefully examined John's system, and indeed, he found that John's system was not correctly implementing IDs as Risk Management. John's system was only taking into account the risk per trade and not per account.

Holmes effortlessly identified that the issue arose because John was not paying close attention to his risks efficiently. He instructed John to update his system's Risk Management functions to reflect account breaches rather than trade breaches.

## The Resolution 

With a sigh of relief, John quickly implemented the changes and tested his system again. The account breach checks alerted John to the risks he was overexposing himself to, and the new implementation ensured that he consistently operated within his Risk Management Rules.

Holmes explained that IDs are essential for Risk Management functions and significantly impact system results. For instance, a trade that has a low risk alone, may be viewed as a high risk for overall account due to overexposure. 

In conclusion, John's trading system had underlying vulnerabilities that escaped his limit-based Risk Management estimation. However, this Sherlock Holmes mystery proved to be an excellent learning opportunity to explore the importance of IDs in Risk Management.
## The Code Solution

In Sherlock Holmes' mystery of "The Anonymous Trader," using the right IDs in Risk Management turned out to be the only solution. To ensure that you don't face the same predicament as John, here's an implementation of the account-based Risk Management system. 

```cpp
double accountRiskLimit = 0.05; // Example account risk limit
double accountBalance = 25000.0; // Example account balance
double currentExposure = 9500.0; // Example current exposure
double lotSize = 0.01; // Example lot size

bool checkRisk(double newOrderRisk) 
{
    double accountRisk = currentExposure + (newOrderRisk * lotSize);
    if ((accountRisk / accountBalance) <= accountRiskLimit) 
    {
        // It's within account risk limits
        return true;
    } 
    else 
    {
        // It violates the account risk limits
        return false;
    }
}
```
In this sample code, we have an account risk limit of 5%. The `checkRisk()` function calculates the new account risk after the addition of a new trade, and it is checked against the risk limit. If the new account risk doesn't exceed the account risk limit, the function returns `true`. If it exceeds the account risk limit, the function returns `false`.

With this implementation, Risk Management is monitored by calculating the new account risk of a trade on an account basis rather than just an individual trade basis. Therefore, the trader can make informed decisions on the amount of risk they want to take for their overall trading account, reducing their exposure to unexpected losses.

Implementing IDs in Risk Management can offer a more realistic view to Risk Management decision-making. By introducing more complex tracking techniques tracking-overexposure, traders can prevent occurrences of risk breaches per trade or per account. In this way, implementing proper Risk Management IDs can save trades, traders, and profits.
